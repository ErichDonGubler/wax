// Breadth is the maximum size (UTF-8 bytes) of component text in a glob expression. For example,
// the breadth of `{a/,a/b/}<c/d:2>` is two (bytes).
//
// Composition is not implemented for breadth and it is only queried from leaf tokens. No values
// are associated with its invariant nor bounds. Breadth is probably the least interesting and yet
// most difficult quantity to compute. Determining correct breadth values likely involves:
//
// - Complex terms that support both running sums and running maximums across boundaries.
// - Searches from the start and end of sub-trees in repetitions, where terminals may interact.
//   Consider `<a/b:2>` vs. `<a/b/:2>`, which have breadths of two and one, respectively.
// - Potentially large sets for bounds. Ranges lose too much information, in particular information
//   about boundaries when composing terms.
//
// There are likely other difficult composition problems. As such, breadth is only implemented as
// much as needed. Any requirements on more complete breadth computations ought to be considered
// carefully.
